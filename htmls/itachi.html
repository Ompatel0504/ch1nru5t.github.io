        <img src="../images/itachi1.gif" align="right" width="300px" height="260px">Itachi Uchiha (うちはイタチ, Uchiha
        Itachi) was a shinobi of Konohagakure's Uchiha clan that served as an Anbu Captain. He later became an
        international criminal after murdering his entire clan, sparing only his younger brother, Sasuke. He afterwards
        joined the international criminal organisation known as Akatsuki, whose activity brought him into frequent
        conflict with Konoha and its ninja — including Sasuke — who sought to avenge their clan by killing Itachi.
        Following his death, Itachi's motives were revealed to be more complicated than they seemed and that his actions
        were only ever in the interest of his brother and village, making him remain a loyal shinobi of Konohagakure to
        the very end.</p>

        was the first child born to Mikoto and Fugaku Uchiha. His early childhood was marked with violence: when he was
        four years old, the Third Shinobi World War waged and he witnessed first-hand many of the war's casualties. The
        death and destruction he experienced at such a young age traumatised Itachi and made him a pacifist, leading to
        him training non-stop to achieve his dream of becoming a ninja among ninja in order to erase fighting from the
        world. At age 5, after becoming a big brother to Sasuke, Itachi was approached by Shisui, who offered to train
        together. Soon, the two became best friends, forming a brother-like bond as they continued to teach the other
        new tricks. During the Nine-Tailed Demon Fox's Attack, he was home alone looking after Sasuke, followed by
        Itachi rescuing Mikoto from falling debris, and in the anime seeking shelter with Izumi. The Nine-Tails' attack
        had soured relations between Konoha's leadership and the Uchiha, the former believing the latter to be
        responsible. The Uchiha were relocated to the edge of the village, isolating them from the rest of the village
        and making it easier to monitor them.</p>

        <img src="../images/itachi3.gif" align="right" width="300px" height="260px">At age six, Itachi enrolled into the
        Academy, where he consistently scored the highest in each subject and quickly learned any skill taught to him,
        resulting in him being praised as the best of his generation. After four months, his teachers unanimously agreed
        let him take the graduation exam early due to Itachi being more than advanced enough for genin-level, which he
        passed later that month. During this time, he began seriously studying the history of the world, gaining a great
        appreciation for it. On the day he graduated as the youngest post-war graduate, he was approached by Danzō
        Shimura, who assessed Itachi's thinking.</p>

        <img src="../images/itachi4.gif" align="left" width="300px" height="260px" style="padding-right: 10px;">At age
        11, he entered the Anbu. Itachi's accomplishments were a source of great pride for his family, his father
        viewing him as proof of the Uchiha's future prosperity and his brother viewing him as a model to live up to.
        Itachi spent a great deal of time with Sasuke, training with him (though rarely actually training him) and
        giving him the recognition their father did not. However, for all the attention he received, few truly
        understood Itachi, believing his isolation to be a result of the gap between his abilities and theirs and not
        his dissatisfaction with the shinobi's life of conflict. Eventually, the Uchiha's disdain for their unfair
        treatment led them to plan a coup d'état. Fugaku, head of the Uchiha and the coup's chief conspirator,
        encouraged Itachi's advancement into the Anbu's ranks as a means of spying on the village. Itachi, however, knew
        an Uchiha coup would lead to intervention from other villages and ultimately start another World War, something
        he could not support. He instead became a double agent, reporting the Uchiha's actions to the Third Hokage and
        the Konoha Council in the hopes it would help them find a peaceful resolution.</p>
