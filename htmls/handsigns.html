        Seals (印, In, English TV: Hand Signs) are used to perform many ninjutsu, genjutsu, and other secret arts other
        than taijutsu. Invented by Indra Ōtsutsuki, they are designed to aid people in properly summoning and
        moulding chakra necessary to perform a technique. There are different sequences of hand seals for every
        technique, requiring memorisation. <br> <br> While techniques may require a number of hand seals to work, a
        skilled ninja can use less or even one to perform the same technique. An example of this is the Water Release:
        Water Dragon Bullet Technique, which requires a total of 44 hand seals to activate. Tobirama Senju, the
        Second Hokage, only needed to use one hand seal to complete the technique, a testament to his skill. In fact,
        by Part II, Sasuke Uchiha has managed to master the Chidori to the point of not needing a single hand seal to
        invoke it and could use Fire Release techniques with only one hand seal. By reading the hand seals of the
        opponent, a ninja can predict the nature of the technique to be performed, which is virtually unavoidable if
        read by the Sharingan.</p>

    <h1>TORI (BIRD)</h1>
    <p
        style="background-color:rgba(255, 255, 255, 0.342); color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0.616); font-size: 32px; font-family:'Trebuchet MS', 'Lucida Sans Unicode', 'Lucida Grande', 'Lucida Sans', Arial, sans-serif;">
        <img src="../images/tori-hand-seal.jpg" align="right" width="300px" height="300px">Tori, or Bird, is based on
        the Chinese zodiac sign, the Rooster. As such, this Naruto hand sign represents the element of Wind or the Wind
        Release nature transformation. It allows the user to procure wind-based ninjutsu techniques. One of the most
        prominent users of this hand sign or the techniques associated with it is Naruto himself, especially when using
        Rasengan.

        The hand sign is quite simple but confusing in fast and precise motions. Your middle finger and pinky have to
        form an angular arch while making your ring finger and index fingers intersect; meanwhile, the thumbs need to
        touch tips.</p>

    <h1>I (BOAR)</h1>
    <p
        style="background-color:rgba(255, 255, 255, 0.342); color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0.616); font-size: 32px; font-family:'Trebuchet MS', 'Lucida Sans Unicode', 'Lucida Grande', 'Lucida Sans', Arial, sans-serif;">
        <img src="../images/boar-hand-sign-naruto.jpg" align="left" width="300px" height="300px">I, or Boar, is based on
        the Chinese zodiac sign of the Pig. It is not crucial for any particular basic nature transformation technique.
        Nevertheless, it is quite essential to a successful summoning jutsu (the one first introduced to Naruto by
        Jiraiya to summon giant sentient toads). <br> At first glance, it looks easy but you might actually strain your
        muscles trying it out. You have to form a partial fist and stick your palms together while keeping your forearms
        parallel to the ground. It's really effective for summoning a dual carpal tunnel syndrome.</p>

    <h1>INU (DOG)</h1>
    <p
        style="background-color:rgba(255, 255, 255, 0.342); color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0.616); font-size: 32px; font-family:'Trebuchet MS', 'Lucida Sans Unicode', 'Lucida Grande', 'Lucida Sans', Arial, sans-serif;">
        <img src="../images/dog-hand-seal-naruto.jpg" align="right" width="300px" height="260px">Inu, or Dog, is -
        unsurprisingly - based on the Chinese zodiac sign of the same animal. Like Tori, the hand sign is also
        instrumental in nature transformation techniques; this one is for the Water Release.
        <br> <br>
        As such, a lot of water-proficient ninjas, such as Zabuza and Kisame, use this hand sign a lot. Inu is one of
        the easiest hand signs to perform. It only involves placing your left open palm atop your right fist</p>
    <hr>
    <h1>TATSU (DRAGON)</h1>
    <p
        style="background-color:rgba(255, 255, 255, 0.342); color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0.616); font-size: 32px; font-family:'Trebuchet MS', 'Lucida Sans Unicode', 'Lucida Grande', 'Lucida Sans', Arial, sans-serif;">
        <img src="../images/naruto-hand-seal-dragon.jpg" align="left" width="300px" height="300px">Also known as the
        Dragon, the Tatsu is based on the Chinese zodiac sign of the same creature. It has no attached elemental
        property to it, meaning it's not needed as a precursor for nature transformation jutsu. However, when used in
        conjunction with those, it produces a dragon-shaped manifestation of that particular element. <br> It's fancy,
        sure, but the cost is you giving yourself some nasty cramps to your fingers. It's quite difficult for a normal
        human to perform the hand sign since it requires you stacking four of your half-closed fingers alternately with
        both of your pinkies sticking out at the bottom and touching at the tips.</p>

    <h1>USAGI (HARE)</h1>
    <p
        style="background-color:rgba(255, 255, 255, 0.342); color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0.616); font-size: 32px; font-family:'Trebuchet MS', 'Lucida Sans Unicode', 'Lucida Grande', 'Lucida Sans', Arial, sans-serif;">
        <img src="../images/naruto-hand-seal-hare.jpg" align="right" width="300px" height="260px">The Hare, or Usagi in
        Japanese, is based on the Chinese zodiac sign of the Rabbit. It's not necessary for basic nature transformation
        but it's commonly used by Sasuke or Kakashi whenever they are channeling the Chidori or lightning hands. <br>
        <br> The hand sign is quite easy on paper but confusing in practice. You can do it by forming a finger pistol
        with your left index finger and thumb sticking out while sliding your right pinky between them; easy, right?

    </p>
    <hr>
    <h1>UMA (HORSE)</h1>
    <p
        style="background-color:rgba(255, 255, 255, 0.342); color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0.616); font-size: 32px; font-family:'Trebuchet MS', 'Lucida Sans Unicode', 'Lucida Grande', 'Lucida Sans', Arial, sans-serif;">
        <img src="../images/naruto-hand-seal-horse.jpg" align="left" width="300px" height="300px">The Uma, which is
        Japanese for the Horse, is based on the Chinese zodiac sign of the same animal. Again, it's unnecessary for
        basic nature transformation release but Sasuke can be seen commonly using the hand sign for his Fireball
        technique. It's also used in dispelling illusory genjutsu techniques.

        <br> It's not as difficult as the Tatsu but you'll need to stretch your fingers quite a bit to do it
        successfully. Your index fingers must connect at the tips while you stack your other finger's knuckles with the
        right digits always at the top. Both palms must also face inward.
