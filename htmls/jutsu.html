        <img src="../images/kakashifast (1).gif" align="right" height="230px" width="350px">Jutsu (術, Literally meaning:
        skills/techniques) are the mystical arts a ninja will utilise in battle. To use a technique, the ninja will need
        to use their chakra. To perform a technique, the ninja will bring out and release the two energies of chakra. By
        forming <a href="handsigns.html" target="_blank">hand seals</a>, the ninja is able to manifest the desired
        technique. Because of the extensive number of hand seals and different combinations, there are thousands of
        potential techniques to be discovered.</p>

        Ninshū (忍宗, Viz: Ninja Creed, Literally meaning: Shinobi Sect) is the religion and the peaceful precursor of
        modern ninjutsu created by Hagoromo Ōtsutsuki, the first one to understand and teach the mystery of chakra. The
        teachings of ninshū were meant to give people a better understanding of themselves, as well as others, and lead
        the world into an era of peace. Ninshū would eventually come to be known as ninjutsu, a more weaponised version
        of the Sage's teachings.</p>

        <img src="../images/ninjutsu.gif" align="right" height="190px" width="350px">Ninjutsu (忍術, English TV: Ninja
        Art, Literally meaning: Ninja Techniques) is one of the three main jutsu categories. Ninjutsu is the most
        nebulous of the three, and may most simply be described as anything that is not genjutsu or taijutsu. Most
        ninjutsu require chakra and hand seals, but this is not always the case since the mere usage of weaponry
        qualifies as ninjutsu.</p>

        <img src="../images/genjutsu.gif" align="left" height="190px" width="350px"
            style="padding-right: 10px;">Genjutsu (幻術, Literally meaning: Illusionary Techniques) is one of the main
        jutsu categories which uses chakra. Unlike ninjutsu, the effects of genjutsu are not real, being only sensory
        illusions experienced by those who fall victim to it. According to the Second Mizukage, genjutsu falls under the
        broad category of Yin Release.</p>

        <img src="../images/taijutsu.gif" align="right" height="190px" width="350px">Taijutsu (体術, Literally meaning:
        Body Techniques) is a basic form of techniques and refers to any techniques involving the martial arts or the
        optimisation of natural human abilities. Taijutsu is executed by directly accessing the user's physical and
        mental energies, relying on the stamina and strength gained through training. It typically does not require
        chakra, though chakra may be used to enhance its techniques. Taijutsu generally requires no hand seals to
        perform, occasionally making use of certain stances or poses, and are far quicker to use than ninjutsu or
        genjutsu. Taijutsu is, simply put, hand-to-hand combat.</p>

        style="background-color:rgba(0, 255, 255, 0.507); color: rgba(148, 47, 16, 0.829); font-size: 32px; font-family:'Trebuchet MS', 'Lucida Sans Unicode', 'Lucida Grande', 'Lucida Sans', Arial, sans-serif;">
        <img src="../images/1000years.gif" align="left" height="190px" width="350px" style="padding-right: 10px;">The
        user tightly clasps their hands together and extends their middle and index fingers, resembling the Tiger hand
        seal. Using the full weight of their body, the user thrusts these four fingers between the target's buttocks.
        Despite the technique's dramatic name, it is not actually harmful. The pain is fairly extreme, however, so much
        so that, when Kakashi Hatake uses it on Naruto Uzumaki, Naruto comically leaps into the air, travelling a fair
        distance. Sakura Haruno blushes to see it used and Sasuke Uchiha declares both Kakashi and Naruto "buffoons".
        The anime shows those who are familiar with One Thousand Years of Death are very unwilling to be subjected to
        it. It has no effect on unconscious targets.</p>

        Great Fireball Technique</h3>

        style="background-color:rgba(0, 255, 255, 0.507); color: rgba(148, 47, 16, 0.829); font-size: 32px; font-family:'Trebuchet MS', 'Lucida Sans Unicode', 'Lucida Grande', 'Lucida Sans', Arial, sans-serif;">
        <img src="../images/fireball.gif" align="right" height="300px" width="350px">The user kneads chakra in their
        body and turns it into fire, which they then expel from their mouth; the more chakra they use, the more flames
        that are produced. Sometimes the flames lack a distinct shape, being only a stream, but more often than not they
        take the form of a giant orb that maintains its shape until hitting a target. Upon impact, the fireball is
        powerful enough to crater the ground and vaporise the surroundings. Against living targets, the fireball can
        cause extensive burns. <br> The Great Fireball Technique was created by the Uchiha clan, and over time became
        one of their signature abilities. The Uchiha in fact used the Great Fireball Technique as a coming of age rite,
        with members not being considered true adults until they learned to perform it. In keeping with this, the manga
        has only ever shown Uchiha using this technique; the anime at times depicts non-Uchiha performing it.</p>

        Jutsu</h3>
    <p
        style="background-color:rgba(0, 255, 255, 0.507); color: rgba(148, 47, 16, 0.829); font-size: 32px; font-family:'Trebuchet MS', 'Lucida Sans Unicode', 'Lucida Grande', 'Lucida Sans', Arial, sans-serif;">
        <img src="../images/shadowclone.gif" align="left" height="300px" width="350px" style="padding-right: 10px;">This
        jutsu allows the user to create one or more copies of themselves. The user's chakra is evenly divided between
        themselves and their clones: creating one clone will give it half the user's chakra, creating two clones will
        give each a third of the user's chakra, and so on. Depending on how much chakra the user has and how many clones
        they make, this rapid depletion of their reserves can be dangerous. Because of this, usually only those of at
        least jōnin-level can safely use the standard Shadow Clone Technique. The Multiple Shadow Clone Technique –
        which creates hundreds of clones to the standard version's dozens – is unsafe to the point of being forbidden.
        Naruto Uzumaki is an exception to this rule; because he has access to the chakra of the Nine-Tails, he can
        create hundreds of clones without worry.</p>

        <img src="../images/rasengan.gif" align="right" height="400px" width="350px">The Rasengan is a spinning ball of
        chakra formed and held in the palm of the user's hand, which is only known to a handful of shinobi. <br> The
        Rasengan was created by Minato Namikaze, which he based on the Tailed Beast Ball. He spent three years creating
        the Rasengan, which he intended to be the highest form of shape transformation. Because it represents the high
        form of shape transformation, mastering the Rasengan also grants the user a great deal of mastery over shape
        transformation, even if they are unaware of the concept of shape transformation. Like many of Minato's jutsu,
        the Rasengan does not require hand seals to perform. Once it is formed, it also does not require any additional
        chakra to sustain it, which means that there is no definite limit to how long the Rasengan can be maintained.
        However, the Rasengan will dissipate if it collides with something, even if it's an unintended target. Though
        the Rasengan's shape is consistent from user to user, its size varies from only barely large enough to be
        noticeable to much larger than the user's hand. Greater experience with the Rasengan allows the user to create
        them in a larger size, and even one in each hand.</p>

        <img src="../images/chidori.gif" align="left" height="300px" width="350px" style="padding-right: 10px;">The
        Lightning Cutter is the special name for Kakashi Hatake's Chidori. <br> Kakashi's Chidori gained the name
        "Lightning Cutter" when he used it to split a bolt of lightning. Although this indicates greater finesse with
        Kakashi's Lightning Cutter than exists with the standard Chidori, it isn't clear how they differ because they
        are performed in fundamentally the same way: both concentrate lightning chakra in the hand; both are used to
        rapidly pierce targets; both cannot be safely used without the Sharingan. When Deidara refers to Sasuke Uchiha's
        jutsu as Lightning Cutter, Sasuke corrects him and explains that his jutsu is technically only a Chidori.</p>
