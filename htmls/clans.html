        <img src="../images/Aburame_Symbol.png" align="right" height="403px" width="350px">The Aburame Clan (油女一族,
        Aburame Ichizoku) is one of the four noble clans of Konohagakure. At birth, members of this clan are offered
        to several special breeds of insects as a nest, residing just under their host's skin. These insects will then
        live in symbiosis with their host from that point on. Because of this, its members are characterised by their
        use of insects as weapons.The clan members may also carry additional insects in jars or gourds with them on
        missions. The insects can leave and enter their host's body through various pores. They feed on chakra as a food
        source, making them quite deadly. The relationship between the shinobi and the insects is mutually beneficial.
        The host grants the insects shelter and allows them to feed off their chakra, their body becoming a living hive
        of tens of thousands of these insects, and in return the insects do the user's bidding, allowing the shinobi to
        perform ninjutsu-like techniques without the use of hand seals or chakra conversion. A major defining trait of
        the Aburame clan is that all of its known members' eyes are obscured usually by glasses, as well as they wear
        clothing that usually cover up most of their body.</p>

        <img src="../images/Akimichi_Symbol.png" align="left" height="403px" width="350px">The Akimichi Clan (秋道一族,
        Akimichi Ichizoku) is one of the four noble clans of Konohagakure.[1] Many of their clan's techniques revolve
        around the manipulation of their bodyweight and size through the use of Yang Release. It has had fifteen family
        heads, with Chōza Akimichi being the fifteenth. Chōji Akimichi is slated to become the sixteenth head.Members of
        the clan possess great physical strength and are able to quickly convert calories into chakra, which they then
        use in their various secret techniques. Most of these techniques rapidly consume the user's chakra during use,
        and maintaining them during a prolonged battle can be tiring. For this reason the Akimichi have high chakra
        levels and eat a lot in order to build up or replenish their chakra reserves. As a tribute, members of the clan
        wear the kanji for "food" (食, shoku) on the their clothing. If standard calories aren't enough for a battle,
        Akimichi can use the clan's Three Coloured Pills to convert excess fat into chakra, at the cost of one's health.

        born into this clan possess the Byakugan, a kekkei genkai that gives them extended fields of vision and the
        ability to see through solid objects and even the chakra circulatory system, amongst other things. Members of
        this clan also possess an innate ability which allows them to expel chakra from any of the tenketsu in their
        body.The Hyūga clan are descendants from the Ōtsutsuki clan, specifically from Hamura Ōtsutsuki's lineage. As a
        result, they are also distant cousins of the Uchiha, Senju, Uzumaki, and Kaguya clans. They are considered to be
        one of, if not currently, the most powerful clan in Konohagakure. Their fame and prowess stretches far and wide,
        leading others to both praise and covet their abilities. During the Fourth Shinobi World War, a Kumo-nin noted
        that they had a hard time against them during a previous war.</p>

        of ninken as fighting companions and are easily identified by the distinctive red fang markings on their
        cheeks.The members are given their own canine partner(s) when they reach a certain age. Thereafter, the shinobi
        and their dog(s) are practically inseparable. The shinobi and canine allies fight using Cooperation Ninjutsu,
        such as the Fang Passing Fang or Fang Rotating Fang techniques amongst others, that take advantage of their
        teamwork and their sharp claws and teeth. The clan members are also able to communicate with canines even if
        unlike Kuromaru, the dogs cannot talk. The members of this clan, much like their canine partners, have greatly
        enhanced senses, especially their sense of smell. By concentrating chakra to their noses, this sense is
        amplified to an even greater extent allowing the user to be able to detect, track and monitor targets from a
        fairly long distance away. The clan's fighting style primarily revolves around their enhanced speed,
        strength and agility granted by the Four Legs Technique and other canine-based attacks, in conjunction with the
        tactical advantages granted by their heightened senses.</p>

        known members have also been devout observers of the Will of Fire.After Konohagakure's formation following the
        Warring States Period, the Sarutobi were amongst the first set of clans to ally themselves with the Senju and
        Uchiha-founded village, alongside the Shimura clan. Not much is known of this clan but, in order to
        strengthen the unity between the Akimichi, Nara, and Yamanaka clans, it has become a tradition that one of the
        Sarutobi give each of the members of the current Ino–Shika–Chō trio special earrings when they swear their
        oaths. Several members were also seen during the Fourth Shinobi World War in the battle against Madara, Obito
        Uchiha, and the Ten-Tails. They used the Fire Release: Great Flame Technique to quickly dry the quicklime which
        was covering the beast.[4]</p>

        being their rival Uchiha clan. Although the clan itself no longer appears to exist as a group, the Senju
        continue to influence Konoha's politics through their philosophy of the Will of Fire and the corresponding
        interpretation of the role of the Hokage position. As such, three Senju have achieved the position of Hokage.As
        descendants of Asura Ōtsutsuki, the Senju inherited his powerful life force and chakra, and through Hashirama
        Senju eventually manifested as Wood Release. Compared to other shinobi clans, the Senju didn't specialise in one
        area, instead mastering ninjutsu, taijutsu, and genjutsu to give them a wide variety of skills to combat their
        enemies. Due to this they acquired their name,"Senju" (千手, Literally meaning: "a thousand skills", "a thousand
        hands"), in reference to their being "the clan with a thousand skills" (「千の手を持つ一族」, "sen no te o motsu
        ichizoku"). It is due to this they were the Uchiha Clan's primary rivals, and ultimately crushed their will
        to fight by the end of the Warring States Period.</p>

        their <a href="sharingan.html" style="color: rgb(143, 40, 40);">Sharingan</a> and natural battle prowess.[2]
        After helping found Konoha decades ago, the Uchiha grew
        increasingly isolated from the village's affairs, culminating in most of their deaths during the Uchiha Clan
        Downfall. Few Uchiha now survive into the present day. <br> The Uchiha are descendants of Indra Ōtsutsuki, the
        elder son of Hagoromo Ōtsutsuki. Through Indra, the Uchiha inherited Hagoromo's "eyes", granting them powerful
        spiritual energy and chakra. As part of the so-called "Curse of Hatred" first displayed by Indra, Uchiha are
        subject to powerful emotions: these emotions typically start as love for a friend or family member that then
        become overpowering hatred when the object of their love is lost. This loss, whether actually experienced or
        merely threatened, awakens an Uchiha's Sharingan. It is due to the Sharingan that the Uchiha have received much
        of their fame and notoriety.</p>

        with the Senju clan. Through the years, the Uzumaki and Senju kept close ties, with members at times marrying
        between clans, as with Hashirama Senju and Mito Uzumaki. Following the founding of Konohagakure at the end of
        the Warring States Period, the Senju chose to symbolise their clans' friendship by adding the Uzumaki's emblem
        to Konoha's flak jackets. Konoha and the Uzumaki's own Uzushiogakure remained close allies over the following
        decades, with the Uzumaki providing fūinjutsu (among other things) to Konoha whenever there was a need. In time,
        the Uzumaki Clan's Mask Storage Temple was even constructed on Konoha's outskirts.</p>
