            Zabuza), given the moniker Demon of the Hidden Mist (霧隠れの鬼人, Kirigakure no Kijin), was a missing-nin from
            Kirigakure's Seven Ninja Swordsmen of the Mist. Before the term of the Fourth Mizukage, Yagura Karatachi,
            Kirigakure began the practice of pitting Kirigakure Academy graduates against each other in death matches as
            a final exam with the exceptionally skilled students named prime candidates for the Seven Ninja Swordsmen of
            the Mist. After Zabuza, not yet a student himself, killed over one hundred Academy students, the practice
            was discontinued and he would thereafter be known as the "Demon of the Hidden Mist". His fame grew over the
            years as he became an Anbu, killing the Konohagakure ninja Kumade Toriichi at that time, before finally
            joining the Seven Swordsmen. At some point, he discovered Haku, a child with a special kekkei genkai and
            began training him to be the ultimate weapon. In the anime, he and Haku witnessed the Kaguya clan attacking
            Kirigakure yet chose not to help his village. Soon after, they encountered Kimimaro, the soon-to-be-sole
            survivor of the Kaguya. Although Haku wanted to talk to the boy, Zabuza forced him to leave Kimimaro alone
            and keep moving.</p>

            <img src="../images/zabu1.gif" align="left" height="415px" width="350px" style="padding-right: 10px;">During
            the Fourth Mizukage's reign over the Bloody Mist, Zabuza came to disagree with the workings of the village.
            He gathered a group of followers and attempted a coup d'etat against the Mizukage, which resulted in a
            failed attempt on Yagura's life. Zabuza subsequently fled with Haku and some other followers, such as the
            Demon Brothers, becoming mercenaries in order to gather funds for a second attempt in the future, which is
            why he worked with Gatō. With his departure he took the Kubikiribōchō with him, causing Kirigakure to lose
            one of its famed swords. Zabuza was initially portrayed as aggressive, arrogant, cruel, cold and ambitious,
            willing to become Gatō's thug to gain enough funds to start a second coup d'etat on the Mizukage, and kill
            anyone who stood in his path, including plotting to kill Gatō once he had received enough funds from him.
            His reputation for cruelty and ruthlessness began as a child where he killed every single candidate in
            Kirigakure's Academy, earning him the moniker of "Demon of the Hidden Mist" (霧隠れの鬼人, Kirigakure no Kijin).
            He willingly uses his own men and others as pawns to fulfil his ambitions, as he raised Haku to be an
            efficient tool to be discarded when he had no use to exploit; although unlike future antagonists, he was
            blunt about the purpose that his recruits were needed for, forgoing any form of manipulation by pretending
            to be benevolent to inspire loyalty. This corresponds with his cynical view of the world, which only
            consists of the used and the users, as well as viewing shinobi to be nothing more than tools. Despite
            himself, Zabuza grew to care deeply for Haku and viewed him to be far more than a tool.</p> <br>
